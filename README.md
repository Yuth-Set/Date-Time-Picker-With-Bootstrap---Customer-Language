Date Time Picker With Bootstrap - Customer Language
This project is a fork of bootstrap-datetimepicker project which doesn't include Time part.
Some others parts has been improved as for example the load process which now accepts the ISO-8601 format.
I've copy/pasted the forked project's documentation and added my specifications.
 
Don't hesitate to download and try it !
